First of all, thank you for downloading and using MTA DayZ. This means a lot to us, as it shows that our work and dedication
will not be in vain. This README aims to show you everything about MTA DayZ, including how to set it up and what commands
are available for admins.

## SETTING UP THE MTA DAYZ SERVER ##
Once you have moved the contents of mtadayz.zip to the resources folder, open acl.xml and add the following lines in the admin group:

    <object name="resource.DayZ"></object>
    <object name="resource.login"></object>
    <object name="resource.slothbot"></object>
    <object name="user.[YOUR_NAME]"></object>
    
    You need edit "[YOUR_NAME]" per your nickname in game for playing with your admin rights.
    Also, you need to make sure the DayZ resource name is written exactly like the folder name (without [] brackets).
    For example, if the folder name is "[DaYZ]", you would write <object name="resource.DaYZ"></object> in acl.xml.
    
Now open mtaserver.conf, scroll down and add these lines:

    <resource src="DayZ" startup="1" protected="0"></resource>
    <resource src="login" startup="1" protected="0"></resource>
    <resource src="slothbot" startup="1" protected="0"></resource>
	
The following resources should have startup set to 0:

mapcycler, mapmanager, scoreboard, spawnmanager, votemanager

And that's it! Start the server and MTA DayZ will start automatically.

## FAQ ##
Q: Help! Vehicles won't spawn/appear!
A: Check the vehicles database. Does it contain any entries? If not, delete the vehicleManager from the console (delaccount vehicleManager) and restart the server.

Q: Error/Warning X is appearing in the server console!
A: Check first has it been listed in the Warnings/Errors FAQ below. In case it is not, then please proceed to create an issue in our Github repository and all the info you can give us( Debugs, Images, CodeSnippets )

Q: What just happened?! I have been kicked when I tried to enter my Rhino!
A: The anticheat measures prevent players who are not admins (ACL-wise) from entering vehicles which do not normally spawn via the MTA DayZ script.

Q: The inventory is broken!
A: Please provide a screenshot/video/accurate description of what exactly broke. Add server log and, if possible, the client log too.

Q: I'm getting this strange error: "Infinite/too long execution (DayZ)".
A: This was fixed in the latest version, please update your server.

Q: How to change backpack slots in this gamemode ?
A: You can do this by modifying the configuration file "cfgServer.lua" (DayZ/configs/cfgServer.lua). Take care to change the "maxslots" variable in the file "cfgSecurity.lua" (DayZ/configs/cfgSecurity.lua) for the anti-cheat.

Q: I want to help developing! How and where can I apply?
A: You can start by creating pull requests, fixing or creating new features. We will contact you if we think you are suited for the job.

Q: There is a question I have that does not appear in the FAQ!
A: You can ask it on our forums or join discord! Alternatively, check our wiki: https://github.com/NullSystemWorks/mtadayz/wiki/Installation-Instructions

## Warnings/Errors FAQ ##

Q: WARNING: DayZ\handlers\players\server\backpack_player.lua:17: Bad argument @ 'destroyElement' [Expected element at argument 1]
A: Happens when a player logs out and his element is destroyed. You can safely ignore it.

Q: WARNING: DayZ\handlers\vehicles\server\actions_vehicles.lua:264: Bad argument @ 'getElementData' [Expected element at argument 1, got boolean]  [DUP x63]
   ERROR: DayZ\handlers\vehicles\server\actions_vehicles.lua:264: attempt to index a boolean value  [DUP x63]
A: Happens when the script tries to respawn a vehicle that exploded, but since it has no respawning coordinates associated with it, it throws out that kind of error/warning. Usually happens when someone adds his own vehicles, but does so improperly.
